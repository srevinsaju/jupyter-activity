# Jupyter Activity
>**Jupyter Notebook** formerly IPython Notebooks) is a web-based 
interactive computational environment for creating Jupyter 
notebook documents. The "notebook" term can colloquially make
reference to many different entities, mainly the Jupyter web
application, Jupyter Python web server, or Jupyter document
format depending on context. A Jupyter Notebook document is
a JSON document, following a versioned schema, and containing 
an ordered list of input/output cells which can contain code, 
text (using Markdown), mathematics, plots and rich media, 
usually ending with the ".ipynb" extension. ~ Wikipedia

This Activity features a Jupyter Labs for students in the 
Sugar theme and its journal contols.

Jupyter is a leading Python Interactive Console, and would be
an enriching beginner to professional coding experience for 
the three popular languages Python, Julia and Ruby.

## Installing

* On desktops with internet, the dependencies, will be
be automatically installed.

### Offline Download
Jupyter needs `jupyter`, `jupyter-lab` and `notebooks` to work
The jupyter activity on launch automatically downloads the 
required dependencies online. 
It is possible to install jupyter on a computer without
internet access. 

#### Downloading Jupyter-Bundle
On a computer with internet access, execute:
```buildoutcfg
./download-jupyter.sh
```
You will notice, the files have been created in a `jupyter-bundle
` directory.

#### Instaling Jupyter
Now, copy these files to a computer without internet
and then execute:
```buildoutcfg
./install-offline-jupyter.sh
```
And now jupyter should have been installed successfully.
You can test it by 
```
jupyter-lab --version
```

### Installing with debian packages only (no pip wheels)
It is partially possible to make this activity work without pip / jupyterlab
package from the PyPI. However this is not recommended, as the core software
`jupyter-lab` is not packaged as a debian package.
(see https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4572 for more information)
As an alternative, on computers without internet connection, `jupyter-activity`
will not fail, and will fallback to `jupyter-notebook` if its installed. This, 
is better, because Debian / Ubuntu provides prebuilt `jupyter [all]` packages for 
jupyter-notebooks to work.
